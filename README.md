    <h1>Windstitch Study</h1>
    <p>This repository is intended for the study of the <b>Windstitch</b> library, which enables the use of the Tailwind framework with components similar to Stitch. It also contains optimized configurations for Next.js 13 and uses tools like lint and commitlint to maintain consistent and standardized code.</p>
    <h2>About Windstitch</h2>
<p>Windstitch is a library that provides a set of pre-built components that can be used with the Tailwind CSS framework. It combines the simplicity and flexibility of Tailwind with the ease of use of pre-built components. This makes it easier to create UIs with a consistent look and feel, without having to build each component from scratch.</p>
